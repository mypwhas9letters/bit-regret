Bitcoin - I could've been a millionaire if I bought it a year ago.

I started learning about bitcoin around the same time I started leaning to code. I started my coding bootcamp on 7-17-17 and paid $15,000 in tuition. If I used that money to buy bitcoin on 7-17-17, it would be worth $127,785.23 today, 12/20/2017.

Today I'm sitting there with the ability to create this project instead of $127,785.23 dollars. So, I created this app to spread my misery.

This app shows you how much money you could've made if you bought bitcoin from an earlier date.
